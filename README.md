# Magnetic-Pendulum
A simple dynamical problem wich shows chaotic behavior and generates a fractal.

Suppose we have a pendulum that is atracted to some magnets below it. If friction is considered, the pendulum will find an equilibrium position, and, if the magnetic atraction is strong enough, the equilibrium position of the pendulum will be 'hovering' over one of these magnets. 
On wich magnet will the system rest on? This depends on the initial position of the pendulum.
If we can assign wich initial position ends up in wich magnet (lets say by coloring it) we get an idea of how sensitive the system is to initial conditions.
We actually end up with a fractal.
